# Event Sync

## Introduction

Event Sync is a full-stack web app built using the tech stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). This application allows users to create, manage, and participate in events. Users can add new events, edit existing ones, delete events, and view a list of all events. Additionally, reminders can be toggled for each event, ensuring users never miss an important date.

## Approach to Create Event Sync

1. Define the structure of an event:

- Use Mongoose schemas in a model file (e.g., Event.js).

2. Develop routes for CRUD operations:

- Create a dedicated eventRoutes.js file for handling Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

3. Set up MongoDB database:

- Establish a connection in your Express application.

4. Create a server file:

- Configure Express to listen on a specific port in a server.js file.

5. Design and implement a form component:

- Use EventForm.js for adding new events.

6. Develop a component to display events:

- Use EventList.js to fetch and display a list of events from the server.

7. Create a detailed event display component:

- Use EventItem.js with features like editing, toggling reminders, and deleting.

8. Style your components:

- Utilize CSS to create an engaging user interface.
